## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 Processing Algorithms
Accessible via the QGIS Processing Toolbox under **Subsea Cable Tools**:
- **Import Excel RPL** – Load route position lists (RPLs) as LineStrings from Excel
- **Highlight KP Ranges** – Visualise KP ranges on cable routes.
- **Find Nearest KP** – Get the closest KP on a cable route to a layer of point(s) data.
- **Import MDB Files** – Extract bathymetric data from `.mdb` survey databases (experimental)

### 🗺️ Map Tool
- **KP Mouse Tool** – Interactive tool that provides closest KP and DCC of the mouse pointer dynamically.

It's a new tool and not extensively tested yet, so apologies if you encounter issues or find the documentation lacking. I'll continue to test and improve the tools.
